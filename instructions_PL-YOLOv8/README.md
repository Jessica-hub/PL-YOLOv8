# Data & Weights Download Instructions

This folder includes instructions for downloading the necessary datasets and installations for the project. The directional block is located in `block.py` within the `ultralytics/nn/modules/` directory, and the `yolov8-ehobb` configuration is under `ultralytics/cfg/models/v8`.You are advised to download the base YOLOv8 model and integrate these modifications. Additionally, the algorithm for assessing vegetation metrics is accessible in Final.py within the veg_encroch_index directory.

**For further reading on the application of this technology, refer to the paper titled "Advanced YOLO-based Real-time Power Line Detection for Vegetation Management," which is currently under review.**

## üìù Additional Notes

- **Dataset Placement:** Ensure that the downloaded datasets are extracted into the correct folders as expected by the training scripts.
- **Model Verification:** After downloading the model weights, verify their integrity before use.
- **Basic YOLOv8 Usage:** For general YOLOv8 usage and examples, refer to the official Ultralytics repository:  
  üîó [Ultralytics YOLOv8 Documentation](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/tree/main)

Happy Training! üöÄüî•
